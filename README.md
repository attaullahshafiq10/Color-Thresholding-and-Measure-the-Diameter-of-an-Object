# Color-Thresholding-and-Measure-the-Diameter-of-an-Object

Measuring  objects  within  an  image  or  frame  can  be  an  important  capability  for  many applications where computer vision is required instead of making physical measurements. This demo  will  cover  a  basic algorithm  for  isolating  a  desired  object  and measuring its diameter. 

Steps:
Color Thresholding
Complete Segmentation and Cleanup Image
Cleanup Image/Remove Noise
Measure the Object Diameter
